# Test Driven Development (TDD)

The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with the opportunity to practice the art of developing high-quality software using the process of [Test Driven Development (TDD)][test-driven-development].

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, students will understand:

* How to use the Red, Green, Refactor approach to design and develop functional, high-quality code.
* How to use code katas to practice and refine development skills.

## Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements

Your code will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* The project must not have any build errors.
* Unit tests pass as expected.
* There is appropriate code coverage to verify the application code is functioning as expected.
* Katas have been completed as assigned.
* Code has been developed using TDD practices. You are expected to:
    * Write a test.
    * **Add and commit the test with the message "Add test method " followed by the test method name**. For instance, "Add test method result_should_be_Fizz_when_number_is_3".
    * Write enough code to make the test pass.
    * **Once the test is passing, add and commit the code with the message "Add passing code for test method " followed by the test method name.** For instance, "Add passing code for test method result_should_be_Fizz_when_number_is_3".
    * Repeat these steps until all tests have been implemented and are passing.
* **Code that does not have an associated unit test will be considered incomplete**.
* Good test method names are provided that clearly state what is being tested.

Remember, when using a test-driven approach to development, you **do not write all of the tests first** and then write all of the code to make the tests pass. TDD follows the following process:

* Write a single test method based on the requirement you are working on.
* Run the tests, and verify that the test fails. (Red)
* Write enough code to make the test pass. (Green)
* Refactor if necessary, and verify that the code still passes. (Refactor)
* Repeat previous steps until all of the requirements have been satisfied.

For this exercise, you will be completing several [code katas][what-is-a-code-kata]. Code katas are a great way to practice your development skills, and are extremely valuable to developers who want to become better practitioners of TDD.

The requirements for each kata are provided below. Your job will be to implement a _test-driven approach_ to solving these problems.

Empty classes and test files have already been created for you.

### [FizzBuzz Kata][fizz-buzz-kata]

#### Part 1

FizzBuzz is a program that interviewers will often have developers they are interviewing with write or discuss during the interview process. We will use this opportunity to practice solving this problem.

Your job will be to create a method called `fizzBuzz`, that will accept an `int`, and returns a `String`. The string that is returned is based on the following requirements:

* If the number is divisible by 3, convert the number to the string, "Fizz".
* If the number is divisible by 5, convert the number to the string, "Buzz".
* If the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, convert the number to the string, "FizzBuzz"
* For all other numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), simply convert the number to a string.
* Any number that is not between 1 and 100 (inclusive), convert the number to an empty string.

The following illustrates these requirements:

| Method Call    | Expected Result |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| `fizzBuzz(1)`  | `"1"`           |
| `fizzBuzz(3)`  | `"Fizz"`        |
| `fizzBuzz(5)`  | `"Buzz"`        |
| `fizzBuzz(15)` | `"FizzBuzz"`    |
| `fizzBuzz(22)` | `"22"`          |
| `fizzBuzz(0)`  | `""`            |

#### Part 2

A new requirement has been added by the interviewer to see how well you adapt to change. The new requirement is as follows:

* If the number is divisible by 3, OR contains a 3, convert the number to the string, "Fizz".
* If the number is divisible by 5, OR contains a 5, convert the number to the string, "Buzz".
* If the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, OR contains a 3 AND 5, convert the number to the string, "FizzBuzz"

For instance:

| Method Call    | Expected Result |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| `fizzBuzz(3)`  | `"Fizz"`        |
| `fizzBuzz(13)` | `"Fizz"`        |
| `fizzBuzz(35)` | `"FizzBuzz"`    |
| `fizzBuzz(5)`  | `"Buzz"`        |
| `fizzBuzz(51)` | `"Buzz"`        |
| `fizzBuzz(53)` | `"FizzBuzz"`    |

Are there any additional cases we might be missing?


## Getting Started

* Import the tdd-exercises project into Eclipse.
* Once you've decided which kata you would like to start with, open the corresponding file in the test/java/com/techelevator directory. For instance, if you are going to start with the FizzBuzz kata, open the `KataFizzBuzzTests.java` file.
* Add a test method to the class for the first scenario you are testing.
* Once you have the test method written, commit the code with the message "Add test method ", followed by the name of the method you are testing. For instance, "Add test method result_should_be_Fizz_when_number_is_3".
* After committing the test code to git, open the class you are testing. For instance, to continue with our example above, open the `KataFizzBuzz.java` file in main/java/com/techelevator.
* Add **only** the code necessary to get the test you wrote in the previous step to pass.
* Now, commit the passing code to git with the message "Add passing code for test method " followed by the test method name. For instance, "Add passing code for test method result_should_be_Fizz_when_number_is_3".
* Repeat these steps until all tests have been implemented and are passing for all katas.

## Tips and Tricks

* Katas are used by many companies during the hiring process when working to find new developers to join their teams. As such, it will be to your advantage to practice writing code with code katas on a consistent basis.
* Often times when teams assign katas for candidates, they are looking to see your thought process over time. That being said, they will often be curious to see your commit history when working through exercises. Avoid the urge to write all of the code up front and then adding a massive commit. Instead, write a little code, commit your code. Write a little more code. Commit. This will allow a reviewer to see how your code has developed over time, and will help reviewers to understand your approach to problem solving.
* Katas are a great way to practice your skills, learn new programming languages, and keep your existing skills fresh. There are a number of katas published online that you are encouraged to work through. Some of these include the [KataCatalogue][kata-catalogue] from [Coding Dojo][coding-dojo], this curated list of [awesome katas][awesome-katas] on GitHub, and [katas available from CodeKata.com][codekata.com].
* Of course, there are more modern ways to complete katas as well, though most of them will not provide you the opportunity to hone your craft of TDD. However, some notable ones include [CodeWars][codewars], [LeetCode][leet-code], and [exercism.io][exercism.io].
