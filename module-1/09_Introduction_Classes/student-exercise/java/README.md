# Introduction to Classes

The purpose of this exercise is to provide you the opportunity to define and use classes. The names of the classes and methods are specified in the Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements section.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, students will understand:

- How to create classes.
- How to create attributes.
- How to create ["getters" and "setters"][java-getters-and-setters].
- How to manage the state of an object.
- How to limit access to attributes through the use of access modifiers.

## Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements

- The project must not have any build errors.
- Unit tests pass as expected.
- Appropriate variable names and data types are being used.
- Code is presented in a clean, organized format.
- If an attribute does not have `set` marked, then a setter should not be defined.
- The code meets the specifications defined below.

## Getting Started

- Import the introduction-to-classes-exercises project into Eclipse.
- Right-click on the project, and select the **Run As -> JUnit Test** menu option.
- Click on the **JUnit** tab to see the results of your tests and which passed / failed.
- Provide enough code to get a test passing.
- Repeat until all tests are passing.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Note: If you find yourself stuck on a problem for longer than fifteen minutes, move onto the next, and try again later.**
- In this exercise, you'll be provided with a series of specification for classes you need to create. Each class comes with its own challenge and nuance, and you may find that some of these classes are more challenging than others to implement.
- In this exercise, create the classes specified in the requirements section of this document. The unit tests you run verify if you have defined the classes correctly. As you work on creating the classes, be sure to run the tests, and then provide enough code to pass the test. For instance, if you are working on the `Product` class, provide enough code to get one of the Product tests passing. Focusing on getting a single test to pass at a time saves a lot of time, as this forces you to only focus on what is important for the test you're currently working on. This is commonly referred to as **[Test Driven Development][introduction-to-test-driven-development]**, or **TDD**.
- What happens if you don't define any [constructors][java-constructors] in a class? Does your code still work as expected? Why or why not?
- When you provide an explicit constructor with arguments in a class, what happens to the default constructor (a constructor with no arguments)?
- Be mindful of your [access modifiers][java-access-modifiers].
