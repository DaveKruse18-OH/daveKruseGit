            <td>That night, a giant rabbit devours many of the town's vegetables. At a town meeting, the hunter Lord Victor Quartermaine offers to shoot the were-rabbit, but Lady Tottington persuades the townsfolk to continue with Anti-Pesto's services. After a failed attempt, Wallace suspects that Hutch may be the were-rabbit and locks him in a high-security cage. Victor, who seeks to woo Lady Tottington, corners Wallace in the forest, but Wallace transforms into the Were-Rabbit under the light of the full moon and flees. Gromit lures Wallace home to protect him. Victor obtains three "24-carrot" gold bullets from the Vicar to use against Wallace.</td>

        <table style="width:50%">
            <td>Wallace, as the were-rabbit, creates chaos at the fair. Using up all his gold bullets, Victor takes the Golden Carrot trophy to use as ammunition. Wallace carries Lady Tottington atop Tottington Hall, where she discovers Wallace's connection to the were-rabbit. Victor gives chase, revealing that he only wants to impress Lady Tottington for her money. Victor's dog Philip engages Gromit in a dogfight in aeroplanes taken from a fairground attraction. Gromit sends Philip's plane to the ground, then steers his plane into Victor's line of fire as Victor fires at Wallace, causing the bullet to hit the plane instead. The damaged plane falls and Wallace jumps to grab Gromit, sacrificing himself to cushion their fall into a cheese tent.</td>
