# Joins

The purpose of this exercise is to practice using [joins][sql-joins] to combine data from multiple tables in a single query result using Structured Query Language (SQL).

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, students will understand:

* How to interpret database diagrams to determine how tables are related.
* How to use SQL `JOIN` clauses to combine data from multiple tables in a database query.
* The difference between `INNER` AND `OUTER` joins and when to use one or the other.
* The difference between a `LEFT` and `RIGHT` join.

## Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements

* All of the queries run as expected.
* The number of results returned from your query is equal to the number of results specified in each question.
* Code is clean, concise, and readable.

To complete this exercise, you need to write SQL queries in the `joins-exercises.sql` file. Below each commented out question, you'll write the query necessary to answer the question being asked using the world database as the source.

## Getting Started

* Open the `joins-exercises.sql` file in DB Visualizer.
* If you have not done so already, create the world database. The script for this should be available in yesterday's lecture code.
* In the "Database Connection" properties above the file, select the world database.
* You can run all of the database commands in the file at one time by pressing the command + enter key at the same time.
* You can run a single database command at a time by highlighting the command and then pressing the command + enter key at the same time.

## Tips and Tricks

* The results of an `INNER JOIN` between tables A and B consist of the intersection of A and B. That is, only the records that exist in both tables based on the `JOIN` condition are returned.
* The results of an `OUTER JOIN` between tables A and B are all of the records that exist in the `LEFT` table (A) and any matches that exist on the `RIGHT`.
* You can specify which table (`LEFT` or `RIGHT`) all of the results should be returned from explicitly.
* See the [PostgreSQL documentation][postgres-joins] for more information on how table joins work in PostgreSQL.
* [Some people find value in using Venn diagrams][venn-diagrams-to-explain-joins] to understand and explain SQL joins, while [others argue that this is wrong and join diagrams are easier to understand][say-no-to-venn-diagrams]. Which one is the correct way to explain table joins? The way that makes the most sense to you is the correct way. Try taking a look at both explanations to determine which one is best for your understanding.
